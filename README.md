### React + MobX boilerplate

* Config

  Copy `.env` to `.env.local` and modify your configs.
  
  Config proxies in `src/setupProxy.js`.
* Install dependences (Recommend to use `yarn`)
  ```
  yarn
  ```
* Run the app (on port `3000`)
  ```
  yarn start
  ```
* Build the app (to `build` folder)
  ```
  yarn build
  ```

Happy Coding!!!
